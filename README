Notes on building the R library blighty:- mainly to me.

If you have the blighty_1.00.tar.gz file from the distribution and you have just untarred it and are wondering what to do then you need to run as root (from outside R and in a directory blighty_1.00.tar.gz can be found):

R CMD INSTALL blighty_1.00.tar.gz

which should install blighty for you to the default R library directory - you can safely remove the directory tree you created by unpacking this tarball.

looking at:

R CMD INSTALL --help

may also be useful.

NOTE - there is a: R CMD install as well, INSTALL and install are two different things.

Notes to me:

Building the package from the source tree

need to be in the directory above the blighty Directory then run a: 

R CMD build blighty

which builds the distribution source so long as all the documentation is ok

#########################################################
Write up the documentation as described in writing R extensions by the R core team into *.Rd files

from within the directory use:

R CMD Rdconv -t html blighty.Rd > blighty.html

to check the formatting on the Rd files



#######################################################
As root from the directory above the source tree do a

R CMD build blighty

This will return some warnings fas there is a 'hidden' function - these warnings can safely be ignored

Which will build the package into blighty_X.XX.tar.gz

Then from the directory with the .tar.gz in as root install by

R CMD INSTALL blighty

Wish list for version 1.20

1. Inclusion of scale (imp miles and ks) and North pointer

2. shading of land - nice if possible

3. cities
